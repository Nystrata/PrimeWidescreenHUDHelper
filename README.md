# PrimeWidescreenHUDHelper
The original [MetroidPrimeWidescreen](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_(GC)#16:9_HUD_Mod) mod has very involved installation steps that require the user to manually extract the ISO, unpack PAK files, and manually copy over the required files.  
  
This batch script package automates it with a simple to run batch script.

# Mod Installation
- Download the original [MetroidPrimeWidescreen from the Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_(GC)#16:9_HUD_Mod) and extract it.
- Download PrimeWidescreenHUDHelper from this repository's Releases page.
- Copy the all of the files and folders from PrimeWidescreenHUDHelper into the extracted MetroidPrimeWidescreen folder
- Place you Metroid Prime (USA) (GM8E01) (0-00) ISO into the MetroidPrimeWidescreen folder,
  **Make sure it is named `prime.iso`.**
- The folder should look like this

- Run the included **patch.bat** and follow the on-screen prompts.
- If everything is successful, prime_widescreenhud.iso should not be created.
